## 2024-05-21 - [Native Form Validation]
**Learning:** This project relies on vanilla HTML/CSS without a JS framework for form validation. The `:invalid` pseudo-class combined with HTML5 constraint attributes (`min`, `max`, `type`) provides immediate visual feedback without complex JS logic.
**Action:** Prioritize HTML5 constraint attributes and CSS `:invalid` styling over custom JS validation to maintain simplicity and accessibility.
