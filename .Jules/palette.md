## 2025-10-26 - Empty State Pattern
**Learning:** Users are often overwhelmed by empty dashes or "0" values on initial load. Replacing these with a dedicated "Empty State" container that provides a clear call-to-action ("Ready for Analysis") significantly improves the initial impression and guides the user.
**Action:** When designing data-heavy views, always consider the "zero data" state. Hide result containers until data is available, and use the space to educate or guide the user.
